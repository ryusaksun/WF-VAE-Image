# Legacy Video Pipeline

This folder keeps the old video-VAE related scripts and examples for reference.

- `legacy/scripts/` contains archived video reconstruction and latent-stat tools.
- `legacy/examples/` contains archived video training/eval shell scripts and configs.
- `legacy/codebase/wfvideo/` stores the archived video model/data/eval implementation.

The main repository workflow has been fully migrated to **image VAE training**.
Use files under `examples/` and `scripts/` in the project root for the current pipeline.
